*Purpose*: Learning to do EDA well takes practice! In this challenge
you’ll further practice EDA by first completing a guided exploration,
then by conducting your own investigation. This challenge will also give
you a chance to use the wide variety of visual tools we’ve been
learning.

# Grading Rubric

<!-- -------------------------------------------------- -->

Unlike exercises, **challenges will be graded**. The following rubrics
define how you will be graded, both on an individual and team basis.

## Individual

<!-- ------------------------- -->

| Category | Needs Improvement | Satisfactory |
|----|----|----|
| Effort | Some task **q**’s left unattempted | All task **q**’s attempted |
| Observed | Did not document observations, or observations incorrect | Documented correct observations based on analysis |
| Supported | Some observations not clearly supported by analysis | All observations clearly supported by analysis (table, graph, etc.) |
| Assessed | Observations include claims not supported by the data, or reflect a level of certainty not warranted by the data | Observations are appropriately qualified by the quality & relevance of the data and (in)conclusiveness of the support |
| Specified | Uses the phrase “more data are necessary” without clarification | Any statement that “more data are necessary” specifies which *specific* data are needed to answer what *specific* question |
| Code Styled | Violations of the [style guide](https://style.tidyverse.org/) hinder readability | Code sufficiently close to the [style guide](https://style.tidyverse.org/) |

*Background*: [Gapminder](https://www.gapminder.org/about-gapminder/) is
an independent organization that seeks to educate people about the state
of the world. They seek to counteract the worldview constructed by a
hype-driven media cycle, and promote a “fact-based worldview” by
focusing on data. The dataset we’ll study in this challenge is from
Gapminder.

# Guided EDA

<!-- -------------------------------------------------- -->

First, we’ll go through a round of *guided EDA*. Try to pay attention to
the high-level process we’re going through—after this guided round
you’ll be responsible for doing another cycle of EDA on your own!

### **q0** Perform your “first checks” on the dataset. What variables are in this

dataset?

    ## 

**Observations**:

- country, continent, year, lifeExp, pop, gdpPercap

### **q1** Determine the most and least recent years in the `gapminder` dataset.

*Hint*: Use the `pull()` function to get a vector out of a tibble.
(Rather than the `$` notation of base R.)

``` r
## TASK: Find the largest and smallest values of `year` in `gapminder`
year_max <- gapminder %>% pull(year) %>% max()
year_min <- gapminder %>% pull(year) %>% min()
```

Use the following test to check your work.

``` r
## NOTE: No need to change this
assertthat::assert_that(year_max %% 7 == 5)
```

    ## [1] TRUE

``` r
assertthat::assert_that(year_max %% 3 == 0)
```

    ## [1] TRUE

``` r
assertthat::assert_that(year_min %% 7 == 6)
```

    ## [1] TRUE

``` r
assertthat::assert_that(year_min %% 3 == 2)
```

    ## [1] TRUE

``` r
if (is_tibble(year_max)) {
  print("year_max is a tibble; try using `pull()` to get a vector")
  assertthat::assert_that(False)
}

print("Nice!")
```

    ## [1] "Nice!"

### **q2** Filter on years matching `year_min`, and make a plot of the GDP per capita against continent. Choose an appropriate `geom_` to visualize the data. What observations can you make?

You may encounter difficulties in visualizing these data; if so document
your challenges and attempt to produce the most informative visual you
can.

``` r
## TASK: Create a visual of gdpPercap vs continent
gapminder %>%
  filter(year == year_min) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = continent, y = gdpPercap)) +
  geom_jitter(width = 0.2, alpha = 0.6) +
  scale_y_log10()
```

![](c04-gapminder-assignment_files/figure-gfm/q2-task-1.png)<!-- -->

**Observations**:

- Africa has the lowest gdp per capita as most of the countries there
  are clustered around 1e+03. The Americas and Europe have more similar
  clustering compared to the other continents, with Europe having a low
  outlier and Americas having 2 high outliers. Asia is the largest
  spread by country as well as a massive outlier way higher than any
  other country.

**Difficulties & Approaches**:

- Some things that I notice are that Oceania only has 2 countries in it,
  which make it harder to compare to the other continents. This approach
  however, still shows their relevance and connection to the other
  continents. I also struggled with the outliers, which I had to use the
  log function to fit everything onto the graph.

### **q3** You should have found *at least* three outliers in q2 (but possibly many more!). Identify those outliers (figure out which countries they are).

``` r
## TASK: Identify the outliers from q2
gapminder %>%
  filter(year == year_min) %>%
  group_by(continent) %>%
  filter(gdpPercap > quantile(gdpPercap, 0.75) + 3 * IQR(gdpPercap)) %>%
  arrange(desc(gdpPercap)) %>%
  select(country, continent, gdpPercap)
```

    ## # A tibble: 5 × 3
    ## # Groups:   continent [3]
    ##   country       continent gdpPercap
    ##   <fct>         <fct>         <dbl>
    ## 1 Kuwait        Asia        108382.
    ## 2 United States Americas     13990.
    ## 3 Canada        Americas     11367.
    ## 4 South Africa  Africa        4725.
    ## 5 Gabon         Africa        4293.

**Observations**:

- Identify the outlier countries from q2
  - Differing from what I saw in q2, the outliers here also include the
    low outliers from Africa which the graph smushes a little making it
    harder to tell. The extreme outlier is from Kuwait in Asia, the
    others are Canada and US from Americas, and South Africa and Gabon
    from Africa.

*Hint*: For the next task, it’s helpful to know a ggplot trick we’ll
learn in an upcoming exercise: You can use the `data` argument inside
any `geom_*` to modify the data that will be plotted *by that geom
only*. For instance, you can use this trick to filter a set of points to
label:

``` r
## NOTE: No need to edit, use ideas from this in q4 below
gapminder %>%
  filter(year == max(year)) %>%

  ggplot(aes(continent, lifeExp)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  geom_point(
    data = . %>% filter(country %in% c("United Kingdom", "Japan", "Zambia")),
    mapping = aes(color = country),
    size = 2
  )
```

![](c04-gapminder-assignment_files/figure-gfm/layer-filter-1.png)<!-- -->

### **q4** Create a plot similar to yours from q2 studying both `year_min` and `year_max`. Find a way to highlight the outliers from q3 on your plot *in a way that lets you identify which country is which*. Compare the patterns between `year_min` and `year_max`.

*Hint*: We’ve learned a lot of different ways to show multiple
variables; think about using different aesthetics or facets.

``` r
## TASK: Create a visual of gdpPercap vs continent
outlier_countries <- c("Kuwait", "United States", "Canada", "South Africa", "Gabon")

gapminder %>%
  filter(year %in% c(year_min, year_max)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(continent, gdpPercap)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  geom_point(
    data = . %>% filter(country %in% outlier_countries),
    mapping = aes(color = country),
    size = 2
  ) +
  scale_y_log10() +
  facet_wrap(~ year)
```

![](c04-gapminder-assignment_files/figure-gfm/q4-task-1.png)<!-- -->

**Observations**:

- Kuwait since 1952 has always been an outlier, but it has decreased
  over the years and is closer to the rest of the Asian countries
  by 2007. Canada and the US seem to have both grown in gdpPercap since
  1952 as well as South Africa and Gabon.

# Your Own EDA

<!-- -------------------------------------------------- -->

Now it’s your turn! We just went through guided EDA considering the GDP
per capita at two time points. You can continue looking at outliers,
consider different years, repeat the exercise with `lifeExp`, consider
the relationship between variables, or something else entirely.

### **q5** Create *at least* three new figures below. With each figure, try to pose new questions about the data.

``` r
## TASK: Your first graph
gapminder %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = gdpPercap, y = lifeExp)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.3) +
  scale_x_log10()
```

![](c04-gapminder-assignment_files/figure-gfm/q5-task1-1.png)<!-- -->

- This graph looks at life expectancy against gdpPercap. The graph shows
  an almost linear rise, showing that the higher the income the longer
  people live. Which makes sense in human context.

``` r
## TASK: Your second graph
gapminder %>%
  group_by(year, continent) %>%
  summarize(mean_lifeExp = mean(lifeExp)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = year, y = mean_lifeExp, color = continent)) +
  geom_line()
```

    ## `summarise()` has regrouped the output.
    ## ℹ Summaries were computed grouped by year and continent.
    ## ℹ Output is grouped by year.
    ## ℹ Use `summarise(.groups = "drop_last")` to silence this message.
    ## ℹ Use `summarise(.by = c(year, continent))` for per-operation grouping
    ##   (`?dplyr::dplyr_by`) instead.

![](c04-gapminder-assignment_files/figure-gfm/q5-task2-1.png)<!-- -->

- This second graph also looks at life expentacy, but instead it is now
  looking at how the life expectancy changed over time. The graph shows
  a steady increase for every country except for Africa which had a
  period of minimal change around 1985-2005. Africa also is seperated
  from the other countries more.

``` r
## TASK: Your third graph
gapminder %>%
  filter(year == year_max) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = pop, y = gdpPercap)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.4) +
  scale_x_log10() +
  scale_y_log10()
```

![](c04-gapminder-assignment_files/figure-gfm/q5-task3-1.png)<!-- -->

- This garph shows the gdpPercap against the population sizes of each
  country. The graph here shows all the points spread out with of course
  some outliers, however the main takeaway here is that there is no
  pattern supporting the idea that there is no correlation.
